# Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles and scripts. All configurations
are maintained to work on both Linux and macOS hosts (with
occasionally inelegant solutions). Everything should fail gracefully,
it is safe to check out this repository into a new home directory.

## Notes

- Set `git config custom.nostatusprompt true` to disable git status
  prompt in repositories where running this is expensive
